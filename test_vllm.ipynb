      "  \"final_reasoning\": \"\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the capital of China. Hmm, I remember from school that China has a capital, but I'm not exactly sure which city it is. Let me think. I've heard of Beijing before. Isn't Beijing a major city in China? I think it's the political center. Wait, I also recall that Beijing has been the capital for a long time. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard of other cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong, which are also important, but I don't think they're the capitals. \\n\\nLet me try to recall any historical context. I think Beijing has been the capital for several centuries, maybe even longer. I'm pretty sure that before 1949, Beijing was the capital of the Republic of China, but after that, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Beijing remained the capital. So, it's been the capital for a while now. \\n\\nI don't think it's Shanghai because I remember that Shanghai is more of a economic hub, like the financial center. So, the capital is probably Beijing. I'm pretty confident about this, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any other countries. For example, I know that Tokyo is the capital of Japan, Seoul of South Korea, and so on. So, for China, it's definitely Beijing. \\n\\nWait, could it be another city? I don't think so. I think I've heard it referred to as the \\\"City of Four Palaces\\\" or something like that, which I associate with Beijing. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. So, the capital of China is Beijing.\\n\",\n",
